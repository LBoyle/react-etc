My progress learning React

Much the same as some of my other repos, I'm just storing my work here. 

# 02-welrod

This is the first version of a chat app I'm making, it will be something like Slack.

Techs:
- Node / Express / MongoDB / socket.io
- React v4 / Redux / Router / jsonwebtoken / axios
- Skeleton.css

It has working JWT authentication and protected routes, bcrypt hashed passwords, register and login, get all users. 

The API works as I want it to for now, can make conversations and send messages, currently building out the front end.
